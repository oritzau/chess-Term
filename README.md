## Welcome to chessTerm! 
### a lightweight, terminal based chess application which allows you to play against a local opponent or face off against yourself. 

## Installation guide:

### Windows: 
#### To start your chess adventure, make sure you have Python 3.10.x installed on your system by opening Command Prompt and using the command "python --version". Download and unzip the file. In command prompt, navigate to the unzipped file (likely in Downloads/chess-Term.zip/chess-Term/src) and run the command "python main.py".


### Linux/MacOS:
#### To start your chess adventure, make sure you have Python 3.10.x installed on your system by opening Terminal (located in Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal on MacOS) and using the command "python3 --version". Download and unzip the file. In your terminal, navigate to the unzipped file likely in (Downloads/chess-Term.zip/chess-Term/src) and use the command "python3 main.py"

### How to play:
#### chessTerm is best enjoyed with a friend as the game does not currently support online or AI opponents. When prompted, enter a name for each player and you will receive a color at random. 

#### Once the game has begun, use '?' to enter info mode, where each board query in the form "c6", "d3", "H4" (not case sensitive) will return information about the selected tile. When you are ready to make your move, enter '!' to switch into play mode, where you will be prompted twice. Select a start tile using the same syntax, and move that piece to another tile by entering your target tile. Because chessTerm is not a visual simulator, pieces must be referenced by their location on the board rather than name.

##### Disclaimer*: chessTerm was made over the course of a few weeks in about 15 hours by a CS student. If you encounter any bugs,especially gamebreaking ones, a ticket or PR would be greatly appreciated.
